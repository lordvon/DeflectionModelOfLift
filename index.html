<h1>The Deflection Model of Lift</h1>

Here I will describe a model of how aerodynamic forces are generated by wings. I found this helpful in understanding wing-based lift devices.
<br />
<br />
Let us observe an airfoil in freestream (wind). The wing deflects a part of this freestream. No energy or momentum is added to the flow.
<br />
<br />
By conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, the part of the freestream that is affected by the wing has a total mass, momentum, and energy that remains the same after it passes the wing (ignoring viscous dissipations). However, The mean direction of said momentum has changed. By Newton's Third Law (every action has an opposite and equal reaction), the reaction to this deflection results in lift and drag.
<br />
<br />
Let's call the angle at which the mean momentum has been deflected (relative to the airfoil chord line) by \(\phi\). Let's represent the mean momentum freestream momentum that is affected by the wing as a vector. Since the total mass and momentum are conserved, the magnitude of this vector is as well. Thus, we can determine the reactions on the airfoil by computing the change in this vector. By simple trigonometry, the lift component is \(sin(\phi)\), while the drag component is \((1-cos(\phi))\). These are the components, not magnitudes. The magnitudes are dependent on how much of the freestream is affected, which is dependent on the particular configuration and geometry of the airfoil. THe lift to drag ratio is then: 

\[{sin(\phi)}\over{1-cos(\phi)}\]

There are other ways that the lift and drag can be affected. These include friction and zero-lift turbulent oscillation (e.g. Karman vortex street). Zero-lift turbulent oscillations turn the momentum vector about a line of symmetry. Normal to this line, the average momentum change would be zero. However, the average momentum change in line with the symmetry line is non-zero. These can affect both lift and drag. They can be included as follows (\(f\) denotes friction, \(r\) denotes zero-lift turbulent oscillations):

\[{sin(\phi)-f_l(\phi)-r_l(\phi)} \over {1-cos(\phi)-f_d(\phi)-r_d(\phi)}\]

\(\phi\) can be determined from lift and drag coefficient data, if proper knowledge and assumptions of \(r\) and \(f\) are known. By curve fitting, a mapping from geometric angle of attack (\(\alpha\)) to \(\phi\) can be determined.
