<h1>The Deflection Model of Lift</h1>

<h2>The Model</h2>

Here I will describe a model of how aerodynamic forces are generated by wings. I found this helpful in understanding wing-based lift devices.
<br />
<br />
Let us imagine an airfoil in freestream (wind). The wing deflects a part of this freestream.
<br />
<br />
By conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, the part of the freestream that is affected by the wing has a total mass, scalar momentum, and energy that remains the same after it passes the wing (ignoring viscous dissipations). However, the mean direction of said momentum has changed. By Newton's Third Law (every action has an opposite and equal reaction), the reaction to this deflection results in lift and drag.
<br />
<br />
Let's denote the angle at which the mean momentum has been deflected (relative to the airfoil chord line) by \(\phi\). Let's represent the mean freestream momentum that is affected by the wing as a vector. Since the total mass and momentum are conserved, the magnitude of this vector is as well. Thus, we can determine the reactions on the airfoil by computing the change in direction of this vector. By simple trigonometry, the lift component is \(sin(\phi)\), while the drag component is \((1-cos(\phi))\). These are the components of a vector of size 1. The magnitudes are dependent on how much of the freestream is affected, which is dependent on the particular configuration and geometry of the airfoil. The lift to drag ratio, which does not require knowledge of the magnitude of the vector (because it cancels out), is then: 

\[\left({L \over D}\right) = {{sin(\phi)}\over{1-cos(\phi)}}\]

There are other ways that the lift and drag can be affected. These include friction and zero-normal turbulent oscillation (e.g. Karman vortex street). Zero-normal turbulent oscillations turn the momentum vector about a line of symmetry. Normal to this line, the time-averaged momentum change would be zero. However, the time-averaged momentum change parallel to the symmetry line is non-zero. These can affect both lift and drag. They can be included as follows (\(f\) denotes friction, \(r\) denotes zero-normal turbulent oscillations):

\[\left({L \over D}\right) = {{sin(\phi)+f_l(\phi)+r_l(\phi)} \over {1-cos(\phi)+f_d(\phi)+r_d(\phi)}}\]

<h2>Practical Determination of \(\phi\)</h2>

With proper knowledge and assumptions of \(r\) and \(f\), \(\phi\) can be determined from lift and drag coefficient data. A mapping from \(\alpha\) to \(\phi\) can be determined.
<br />
<br />
In the case of a 'perfect deflector', \(\phi = \alpha\), where \(\alpha\) is the geometric angle of attack. Experimental data however suggest that this is a highly improbable occurence. For a 'good deflector', there is some mapping from \(\phi\) to \(\alpha\) where \(\phi\) increases with \(\alpha\), and the zero-normal turbulent oscillation and frictional components do not have a dependence on \(\alpha\) and are constant or non-existent. This could be a reasonable realization with non-stalling wings.
<br />
<br />
For airplane wings, we may assume the zero-normal turbulent oscillations to be zero and the friction term to be constant (not dependent on \(\phi\) or \(\alpha\)). We will assume the lift to drag ratio to have the form:

\[\left({L \over D}\right) = {sin(\phi) \over 1-cos(\phi)+f(0)}\]

The drag friction term is assumed to be constant and determined when \(\phi = 0\). Then for the force coefficients, the following expressions can be used:

\[C_L = S_Lsin(\phi)\]

\[C_D = S_D(1-cos(\phi))+C_{D0}\]

Where \(S\) denotes scaling factors. \(S_L\), \(S_D\), and \(C_{D0}\) (zero-lift drag coefficient) are variables found from experimental measurements of lift and drag coefficients. We can see from \(C_L \over C_D\) that to obtain the form of the expressions from earlier, \(S_L = S_D\). We can compute empirical lift to drag ratios and then find the corresponding \(\phi\) by equation with the theoretical equation. After subtracting out \(C_{D0}\) from the empirical drag, we can compare the empirical lift to drag ratio with the expression that disregards friction:

\[\left({L \over D}\right) = {sin(\phi) \over 1-cos(\phi)} = {C_L \over C_D - C_{D0}}\]

We can simplify the expression further by using the following trignonmetric identities:

\[sin(2\phi) = 2sin(\phi)cos(\phi)\]
\[sin^2(\phi) = {1-cos(2\phi) \over 2}\]

The form to be used by the lift component:

\[sin(\phi) = 2sin(\phi/2)cos(\phi/2)\]

The form to be used by the drag component:

\[1-cos(\phi) = 2sin^2(\phi/2)\]

Then:

\[\left({L \over D}\right) = {2sin(\phi/2)cos(\phi/2) \over 2sin^2(\phi/2)} = {cos(\phi/2) \over sin(\phi/2)} = cot(\phi/2)\]

The expression for \(\phi\) then becomes:

\[\phi = 2cot^{-1}\left({C_L \over C_D - C_{D0}}\right)\]

\(C_L\) and \(C_D\) are dependent on \(\alpha\), and thus a mapping from \(\alpha\) to \(\phi\) can thus be obtained.

<h2>Stall</h2>

Notice that the above developments predict that if \(L/D\) falls, then the lift component increases. However, this does not occur in stall. Lift drastically decreases, while drag drastically increases, and \(L/D\) falls. This means that there is a significant increase in the zero-normal turbulent oscillation component to drag (and perhaps some increase in the frictional component).
<br />
<br />
Stall regions can still be modeled and assigned a value of \(\phi\), by obtaining the pre-stall \(\phi\) angle corresponding to the post-stall lift coefficient value. Then augment the denominator (drag coefficient) of the pre-stall \(\phi\) with the post-stall drag coefficient. The increase in drag coefficient can be assumed to be from zero-normal turbulent oscillation.
