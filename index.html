<h1>The Deflection Model of Lift</h1>

<h2>The Model</h2>

Here I will describe a model of how aerodynamic forces are generated by wings. I found this helpful in understanding wing-based lift devices.
<br />
<br />
Let us imagine an airfoil in two-dimensional freestream. The wing deflects a part of this freestream.
<br />
<br />
By conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, the part of the freestream that is affected by the wing has a total mass, scalar momentum, and energy that remains the same after it passes the wing (ignoring viscous dissipations). However, the mean direction of said momentum has changed. By Newton's Third Law (every action has an opposite and equal reaction), the reaction to this deflection results in lift and drag.
<br />
<br />
Let's denote the angle at which the mean momentum has been deflected (relative to the airfoil chord line) by \(\phi\). Let's represent the mean freestream momentum that is affected by the wing as a vector. Since the total mass and momentum are conserved, the magnitude of this vector is as well. Thus, we can determine the reactions on the airfoil by computing the change in direction of this vector. By simple trigonometry, the lift component is \(sin(\phi)\), while the drag component is \((1-cos(\phi))\). These are the components of a vector of size 1. The magnitudes are dependent on how much of the freestream is affected, which is dependent on the particular configuration and geometry of the airfoil. The lift to drag ratio, which does not require knowledge of the magnitude of the vector (because it cancels out), is then: 

\[\left({L \over D}\right) = {{sin(\phi)}\over{1-cos(\phi)}}\]

There are other ways that the lift and drag can be affected. These include friction and zero-normal turbulent oscillation (e.g. Karman vortex street). Zero-normal turbulent oscillations turn the momentum vector about a line of symmetry. Normal to this line, the time-averaged momentum change would be zero. However, the time-averaged momentum change parallel to the symmetry line is non-zero. These can affect both lift and drag. They can be included as follows (\(f\) denotes friction, \(r\) denotes zero-normal turbulent oscillations):

\[\left({L \over D}\right) = {{sin(\phi)+f_l(\phi)+r_l(\phi)} \over {1-cos(\phi)+f_d(\phi)+r_d(\phi)}}\]

<h2>Practical Determination of \(\phi\)</h2>

With proper knowledge and assumptions of \(r\) and \(f\), \(\phi\) can be determined from lift and drag coefficient data. A mapping from \(\alpha\) to \(\phi\) can be determined.
<br />
<br />
In the case of a 'perfect deflector', \(\phi = \alpha\), where \(\alpha\) is the geometric angle of attack. Experimental data however suggest that this is a highly improbable occurence. For a 'good deflector', there is some mapping from \(\phi\) to \(\alpha\) where \(\phi\) increases with \(\alpha\), and the zero-normal turbulent oscillation and frictional components do not have a dependence on \(\alpha\) and are constant or non-existent. This could be a reasonable realization with non-stalling wings.
<br />
<br />
For airplane wings, we may assume the zero-normal turbulent oscillations to be zero and the friction term to be constant (not dependent on \(\phi\) or \(\alpha\)). We will assume the lift to drag ratio to have the form:

\[\left({L \over D}\right) = {sin(\phi) \over 1-cos(\phi)+f(0)}\]

The drag friction term is assumed to be constant and determined when \(\phi = 0\). Then for the force coefficients, the following expressions can be used:

\[C_L = S_Lsin(\phi)\]

\[C_D = S_D(1-cos(\phi))+C_{D0}\]

Where \(S\) denotes scaling factors. \(S_L\), \(S_D\), and \(C_{D0}\) (zero-lift drag coefficient) are variables found from experimental measurements of lift and drag coefficients. We can see from \(C_L \over C_D\) that to obtain the form of the expressions from earlier, \(S_L = S_D\). We can compute empirical lift to drag ratios and then find the corresponding \(\phi\) by equation with the theoretical equation. After subtracting out \(C_{D0}\) from the empirical drag, we can compare the empirical lift to drag ratio with the expression that disregards friction:

\[\left({L \over D}\right) = {sin(\phi) \over 1-cos(\phi)} = {C_L \over C_D - C_{D0}}\]

We can simplify the expression further by using the following trignonmetric identities:

\[sin(2\phi) = 2sin(\phi)cos(\phi)\]
\[sin^2(\phi) = {1-cos(2\phi) \over 2}\]

The form to be used by the lift component:

\[sin(\phi) = 2sin(\phi/2)cos(\phi/2)\]

The form to be used by the drag component:

\[1-cos(\phi) = 2sin^2(\phi/2)\]

Then:

\[\left({L \over D}\right) = {2sin(\phi/2)cos(\phi/2) \over 2sin^2(\phi/2)} = {cos(\phi/2) \over sin(\phi/2)} = cot(\phi/2)\]

The expression for \(\phi\) then becomes:

\[\phi = 2cot^{-1}\left({C_L \over C_D - C_{D0}}\right)\]

\(C_L\) and \(C_D\) are dependent on \(\alpha\), and thus a mapping from \(\alpha\) to \(\phi\) can thus be obtained.

<h2>Stall</h2>

Notice that the above developments predict that if \(L/D\) falls, then the lift component increases. However, this does not occur in stall. Lift drastically decreases, while drag drastically increases, and \(L/D\) falls. Within the lens of our deflection model, this can be construed as a decrease in mean flow deflection and a increase in the zero-normal turbulent oscillation component to drag (and perhaps some change in the frictional component).
<br />
<br />
Stall regions can still be modeled and assigned a value of \(\phi\), by obtaining the pre-stall \(\phi\) angle corresponding to the post-stall lift coefficient value. The increase in post-stall drag coefficient compared to the pre-stall value can be assumed to be solely from zero-normal turbulent oscillation.

<h2>Tip Vortices</h2>

Tip vortices from the lens of the deflection model is a transfer of momentum to the wing due to the turning of the momentum vector in the spanwise direction, rather than the pitchwise direction we have discussed so far. As is obvious (hopefully) from the description of the deflection model, spanwise deflection significantly contributes to the drag component, and does not affect the lift component.

<h1>Application: Blade Element Momentum Deflection Theory</h1>
<h3>Impetus</h3>
<p>Here I detail a blade element momentum theory (BEMT) variant that utilizes the deflection model and the Euler pump equation. It can be called the blade element momentum deflection theory (BEMDT).</p>
<p>The point of this model is to be a rotor performance prediction model that obeys physics, specifically the conservation of momentum and energy. That is, for any values of \(\phi\), the results should not violate actuator disk momentum theory. Put another way, the Figure of Merit of any results should never exceed 1. I am not saying this model will do so (that remains to be seen), but that is the goal.</p>
<h3>Qualitative Description</h3>
<p>The blade element 'sees' a freestream that is made up of the rotor speed and an inflow. This inflow is not the same as typically used in BEMT analysis, in that it is not at the location of the rotor disk. Here, it is some distance upstream, and has the speed that the blade sees when acting as a deflector. To explain this idea, imagine an airfoil in freestream. Speed increases to much greater values near the front, over the top, and aft of the airfoil than that of the freesream, but the speed that the wing sees as a deflector is the freestream speed.</p>
<p>
From the Euler pump equation (shown later) we see that the energy put into the fluid shows as either kinetic energy of the flow or a pressure change. In the actuator disk model, the velocity does not change at the fan, but rather an instantaneous pressure change occurs. The resulting velocity increase further downstream that accounts for the thrust and required energy is a result of the pressure reducing to ambient pressure (via Bernoulli's relation for incompressible and inviscid flow).
</p>

</ul>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<p>
From experimental data, we can obtain a mapping (as described before) from \(\beta\) to \(\phi\), such that \(\phi = M(\beta)\).
</p>
<p>
Invoking the Euler Pump Equation [1]:
</p>
\[\left( p_2 + \rho \left( c_2^2 \over 2 \right) \right) - \left( p_1 + \rho \left( c_1^2 \over 2 \right) \right) = \rho \omega r c_{2\theta}\]
\[ { { p_2 - p_1 } \over \rho } = \omega r c_{2\theta} - {{ c_2^2-c_1^2 } \over 2} \]
\[ \Delta p = E_D - \Delta k \]
\[\Delta p = p_2 - p_1, E_D = \rho \omega r c_{2\theta}, \Delta k = \rho {{ c_2^2-c_1^2 } \over 2}\]
<p>If we assume that the velocity does not increase across the rotor plane, but instead there is an instantaneous pressure change, then \(\Delta k = 0\). \(\Delta p \) can be calculated as \(T_{ring} \over A_{ring}\). Then the swirl velocity is calculated straightforwardly as:
</p>
\[c_{2\theta} = {T_{ring} \over {2 \rho \omega r A_{ring}}}\]
<p>
The swirl velocity is important because it helps determine the air deflection angle induced by the blade (element).
</p>
<p>
Now down to the trigonometry of the air deflection by the blade element. The blade 'sees' the combination of the inflow (\(c_1\)) and rotor speed (\(\omega r\)) momentum as the vector \(\mathbf{P}\), which makes an angle \(\delta\) with the rotor plane. We assume there is no swirl above the rotor disk. The blade deflects this vector some angle \(\phi\) to get \(\mathbf{P'}\). \(\mathbf{P'}\) makes an angle \(\psi\) with the rotor plane.
</p>
\[\mathbf{V} = \left[ \begin{matrix} \omega r \\ -c_1 \end{matrix} \right]\]
\[ \mathbf{V'} = \mathbf{R}(\phi) \mathbf{V} = \left[ \begin{matrix} cos(-\phi) \omega r + sin(-\phi) c_1 \\ sin(-\phi) \omega r - cos(-\phi) c_1 \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} cos(\phi) \omega r - sin(\phi) c_1 \\ -sin(\phi) \omega r - cos(\phi) c_1 \end{matrix} \right]\]
\[ \mathbf{R}(\phi) = \left[ \begin{matrix} cos(-\phi) & -sin(-\phi) \\ sin(-\phi) & cos(-\phi) \end{matrix} \right]
 = \left[ \begin{matrix} cos(\phi) & sin(\phi) \\ -sin(\phi) & cos(\phi) \end{matrix} \right] \]
<p>
The swirl velocity calculated earlier should match the deficit in the rotor speed direction caused by the deflection of \(\mathbf{P}\). Put another way:
</p>
\[ c_{2\theta} = (\mathbf{V'}-\mathbf{V})\cdot\mathbf{\hat{x}}
 = \left[ \begin{matrix} cos(\phi) \omega r - sin(\phi) c_1 - \omega r \\ -sin(\phi) \omega r - cos(\phi) c_1 + c_1 \end{matrix} \right]\cdot\left[ \begin{matrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right]
 = \left[ \begin{matrix} (cos(\phi) - 1) \omega r - sin(\phi) c_1 \\ -sin(\phi) \omega r + (1 - cos(\phi)) c_1 \end{matrix} \right]\cdot\left[ \begin{matrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right]
 = sin(\phi) c_1 - (cos(\phi) - 1) \omega r \]
<p>
Where \(\mathbf{\hat{x}}\) is a unit vector in the direction of the blade element movement, or \(\left[ \begin{matrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right]\). The velocity of \(c_{2\theta}\) is passed onto the outflow. By mass conservation, the vertical velocity is the same just before and just after the rotor disk; note that a swirl velocity does not alter this fact, because the swirl happens tangent to the rotor disk surface and thus does not contribute to mass flow. The momentum and energy associated with the swirl velocity is conserved by being passed onto the rotor blades (ultimately as power).
</p>
<p>
Now, we can get the equation for \(c_1\) (the inflow):
</p>
\[ c_1 = {{c_{2\theta} + (cos(\phi) - 1) \omega r }\over sin(\phi)} \]
<p>For the case of \(\phi = 0\), we can use our intuition to realize that it \(c_1\) will actually be 0, since no deflection means no transfer of (axial) momentum to the flow, and thus no inflow will be induced. However, note that thus far we have assuemd a swirl velocity implies delfection. If you imagine a rotor with circular cylinders as blades, we know that no thrust will be produced but we can guess that a swirl velocity will still be produced. Swirl velocity due to oscillatory deflection or viscous effects could be added to the Euler pump equation to get a more practical result. However, the point now is to develop a blade element theory that obeys mass, momentum, and energy conservation, so this concern will not be included here.</p>
<p>
The inflow angle:
</p>
\[ tan(\delta) = { c_1 \over {\omega r}} \]
\[ tan(\delta) \omega r =  c_1  \]
<p>\(\phi\) is a function of \(\delta\) and this function is a characteristic of the blade and is given as an input: </p>
\[ tan(\delta) \omega r = {{c_{2\theta} + (cos(\phi(\delta)) - 1) \omega r }\over sin(\phi(\delta))} \]
<p>The above equation can be solved for \(\delta\) given the inputs and some numerical iterative scheme, for each blade element sweep area. Then we can get the performance by obtaining the \(L \over D \) ratio (for inviscid, non-oscillatory flow):</p>
\[\left({L \over D}\right)_{ring} = {sin(\phi) \over 1-cos(\phi)} \]
<p>And:</p>
\[\left[ \begin{matrix} D_{ring} \\ T_{ring} \end{matrix} \right] = \mathbf{R}(\delta)\left[ \begin{matrix} \left({T_{ring}'\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}}\right) \\ T_{ring}' \end{matrix} \right]  \]
<p>Where \(D_{ring}\) is the drag the blade and \(T_{ring}'\) is the lift generated in the rotated, blade-local frame where \(\mathbf{P}\) runs along the horizontal. \(T_{ring}'\) can be determined from the thrust specification: </p>
\[\left[ \begin{matrix} D_{ring} \\ T_{ring} \end{matrix} \right] =  \left[ \begin{matrix} cos(\delta) & sin(\delta) \\ -sin(\delta) & cos(\delta) \end{matrix} \right]\left[ \begin{matrix} \left({T_{ring}'\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}}\right) \\ T_{ring}' \end{matrix} \right]
= \left[ \begin{matrix} cos(\delta) \left({T_{ring}'\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}}\right)+sin(\delta)T_{ring}' \\ -sin(\delta) \left({T_{ring}'\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}}\right)+cos(\delta)T_{ring}' \end{matrix} \right]
= T_{ring}'\left[ \begin{matrix} {cos(\delta)\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}} +sin(\delta) \\ {-sin(\delta)\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}} +cos(\delta) \end{matrix} \right]
 \]
\[ T_{ring}' = { T_{ring} \over {-sin(\delta)\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}} +cos(\delta)} \]
<p>Now, the power can be computed:</p>
\[ P_{ring} = D_{ring} \omega r \]

<h3>Summarized Algorithm</h3>
\[c_{2\theta} = {T_{ring} \over {2 \rho \omega r A_{ring}}}\]
\[ tan(\delta) \omega r = {{c_{2\theta} + (cos(\phi(\delta)) - 1) \omega r }\over sin(\phi(\delta))} \]
\[\left({L \over D}\right)_{ring} = {sin(\phi) \over 1-cos(\phi)} \]
\[ T_{ring}' = { T_{ring} \over {-sin(\delta)\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}} +cos(\delta)} \]
\[ D_{ring} = T_{ring}'\left({cos(\delta)\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}} +sin(\delta)\right) \]
\[ P_{ring} = D_{ring} \omega r \]
<p>Turns out, this algorithm as it is does not work in that the Figure of Merit can exceed 1. Here I make a modification to the swirl velocity following [2], and doing away with the prior definition where the swirl velocity is determined immediately from input parameters. Assuming zero swirl before air enters the rotor: </p>
\[ Swirl Power = Blade Power \]
\[\dot{m}_{ring} c_{2\theta} r = P_{ring}\]
\[\rho c_1 A_{ring} c_{2\theta} r = P_{ring} \]
\[\rho c_1 A_{ring} c_{2\theta} = D_{ring} \omega \]
\[ c_1 = tan(\delta) \omega r  \]
\[\rho \ tan(\delta) r A_{ring} c_{2\theta} = D_{ring} = { T_{ring} \over {-sin(\delta)\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}} +cos(\delta)} \left({cos(\delta)\over \left({L \over D}\right)_{ring}} +sin(\delta)\right)\]
\[ c_{2\theta} = {D_{ring} \over { \rho \ tan(\delta) r A_{ring}  }} \]

<p>The new relation for \(c_{2\theta}\) can be substituted into the deflection equation, and then \(\delta\) can be iteratively solved for as before. With the \(D_{ring}\) used at the solved \(\delta\), the power can be computed.</p>
